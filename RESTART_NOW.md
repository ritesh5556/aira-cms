# ðŸ”¥ CRITICAL FIX APPLIED - RESTART REQUIRED

## What Was Wrong

The `src/api/sso-auth/index.js` was **empty**, so Strapi wasn't loading the API routes at all!

## What I Fixed

I registered the SSO route **programmatically** in `src/index.ts` using the `register()` function.

## RESTART STRAPI NOW

**Stop** the current server (Ctrl+C) and run:

```bash
npm run develop
```

## Expected Startup Logs

You should now see:

```
ðŸ”¥ Registering SSO custom route
âœ… SSO route registered at /api/sso-login
ðŸš€ Loading SSO Auth API
ðŸ”¥ SSO Auth routes loaded
ðŸŽ® SSO Auth API Controller loaded
```

## Then Test Again

```bash
node test-sso.js
```

Copy the URL and test in browser.

## Expected Endpoint Logs

When you hit the endpoint, you should see:

```
ðŸ”µ ========== SSO LOGIN ENDPOINT HIT ==========
ðŸ”µ Query params: { token: '...' }
ðŸ”µ SSO_SECRET configured: true
âœ… Token verified successfully
```

**The route is now registered!** Just restart Strapi. ðŸš€
