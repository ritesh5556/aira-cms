# ✅ FINAL FIX - Custom Route in src/routes/

## The Problem

Trying to register routes programmatically or through the API folder wasn't working due to timing and registration issues.

## The Solution

Created a **custom route file** at `src/routes/sso.js` which Strapi automatically loads. This is the simplest and most reliable way to add custom routes in Strapi 5.

## What I Did

1. ✅ Created `src/routes/sso.js` with the complete SSO logic inline
2. ✅ Removed problematic code from `src/index.ts`
3. ✅ Used inline handler function (no external controller reference needed)

## File Structure

```
src/
├── routes/
│   └── sso.js          ← NEW! Auto-loaded by Strapi
├── api/
│   └── sso-auth/       ← Can ignore this now
└── index.ts            ← Back to default
```

## Restart Strapi

```bash
npm run develop
```

## Expected Output

Strapi should start without errors. The route will be available at:

```
GET http://localhost:1337/sso-login?token=YOUR_TOKEN
```

Note: No `/api` prefix needed! Custom routes in `src/routes/` are at root level.

## Test It

```bash
# Generate token
node test-sso.js

# Update the test URL in test-sso.js if needed, or manually test:
# http://localhost:1337/sso-login?token=YOUR_TOKEN
```

## Expected Logs

When you hit the endpoint:

```
🔵 ========== SSO LOGIN ENDPOINT HIT ==========
🔵 Query params: { token: '...' }
🔵 SSO_SECRET configured: true
✅ Token verified successfully
🔵 Payload: { email: 'test@example.com', ... }
🔵 Looking for admin user with email: test@example.com
🔵 Admin user not found, creating new user
🔵 Creating admin user with role ID: 1
✅ Admin user created: 1
🔵 Generating admin JWT token
✅ Admin JWT generated
🔵 Setting cookie: jwtToken
✅ Cookie set, redirecting to /admin
🔵 ========== SSO LOGIN COMPLETE ==========
```

## Update Test Script

Since the route is now at `/sso-login` (not `/api/sso-login`), update `test-sso.js` line 15:

```javascript
console.log(`http://localhost:1337/sso-login?token=${token}`);
```

## Why This Works

- Strapi automatically loads files from `src/routes/`
- No controller registration needed
- Inline handler function has direct access to `strapi` global
- No timing issues

**This should work!** Just restart Strapi and test with the corrected URL. 🚀
